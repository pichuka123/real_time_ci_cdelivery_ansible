#10.0.1.224 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/id_rsa ansible_user=ec2-user
# this is when you try to include id_rsa (privatekey) in jenkins/utils server's /etc/ansible/id_rsa
# and try to deploy, but it will fail eventually due to poor id_rsa file permissions 600/644 which
# jenkins pipeline is not allowing.
# so, we use as above, and we can remove /etc/ansible/id_rsa also from utils/jenins server.
